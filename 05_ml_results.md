### Machine Learning Analysis

The datasets analyzed in Azure Machine Learning (AML) Studio as follows:

1. Load datasets as CSV files into AML
2. Create workflows for Chlorophyll-A$^{4}$ and DO$^{5}$ datasets
3. Each workflow trained dataset with various classification algorithms
4. Algorithms evaluated the "resultscore" data attribute
5. Accuracy and feature important was evaluated from each workflow

### Results

Results of each workflow were as listed below; tables accuracy and feature importance are shown in the main contest entry submittal. Fewer data attributes were included in the workflow to control the study scope which affected the results.

Chlorophyll-A Data:
1. Logistic regression algorithm performed the best; however, accuracy was ~50% which may have been due too few features being included for analysis.
2. Water body and station locations had a mild influence on result score.

Dissolved Oxygen Data:
1. Logistic regression algorithm performed the best; however, accuracy was ~50% which may have been due too few features being included for analysis.
2. Water body and station locations had a mild influence on result score.
