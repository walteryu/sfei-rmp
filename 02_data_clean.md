### Data Cleaning, Preparation and Analysis

Data cleaning was completed prior to analysis  as follows:

1. Removed empty and missing values since they may cause errors during analysis.
2. Removed negative values since they may skew summary statistics and results.

After data cleaning, summary statistics were prepared for the dataset per table and bar chart shown below to separate results by analyte into its own dataframe for machine learning analysis.
