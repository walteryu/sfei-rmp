### Next Steps

The following steps can be taken to further improve the model based on data exploration, visualization and modeling:

1. Include additional data attributes into AML workflow to improve accuracy.
2. Analyze feature important of additional attributes.
3. Specifically, consider collection date/time and location (lat/long).
4. Discuss/review results with SFEI subject matter experts.

Assumptions made in this study are based on available literature; as a result, review and discussion with SFEI subject matter experts would provide additional insights. Specifically, how to interpret the results and develop a narrative around the results.

### Conclusion

The study answered the questions posed in the introduction as follows:

1. Which data attributes most influence DO, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), ammonium (as N) and ammonia (as NH^3) levels?
<br></br>
**Water body and station location had a mild influence on results; however, additional data attributes in machine learning may yeild better results.**
<br></br>
<br></br>

2. Does identifying these attributes lead to insights regarding possible causes for increasing nutrients?
<br></br>
**Additional analysis is required to improve accuracy before inferring possible causes.**
<br></br>
<br></br>

3. What trends were identified with this study?
<br></br>
**The CD3 database provides good quality datasets for analyzing nutrients in the SF Bay. Classification algorithms work reasonably well given few attributes, and accuracy should improve with additional data. Collection date/time and location (lat/long) may provide additional insights.**
<br></br>
<br></br>

4. What are some next steps and recommendations based on additional analysis?
<br></br>
**Provide additional data attributes in AML workflows and complete additional analysis on subsets of the data.**
<br></br>
<br></br>

Although the results of this study were affected by control of scope, it provides a good start to machine learning analysis of nutrients in the SF Bay for additional analysis and consideration.
