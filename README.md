## Machine Learning Analysis of Nutrients in the SF Bay

### Author: Walter Yu, P.E.

### Abstract

Nutrients present in the SF Bay are linked to higher algae blooms and toxins which result in lower dissolved oxygen (DO), negative impacts to fish habitat and lower the overall water quality. This topic was covered as a feature article in the 2017 Pulse of the Bay<sup>1</sup> which included data analysis of SF Bay monitoring results; as a result, this study continues such analysis with machine learning to identify other potential insights from monitoring data.

### Introduction

This study outlines the data, methods and results used to identify trends in the SF Estuary Institute (SFEI) Regional Monitoring Program (RMP) water quality and toxicity monitoring results from the Contaminant Data Display and Download (CD3) database<sup>2</sup>. Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:

1. Which data attributes most influence DO, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), ammonium (as N) and ammonia (as NH^3) levels?
2. Does identifying these attributes lead to insights regarding possible causes for increasing nutrients?
3. What are some next steps and recommendations from this study?

### Data Analysis

This study analyzes the DO, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), ammonium (as N) and ammonia (as NH^3) from the CD3 dataset. Specifically, monitoring results were analyzed to identify potential insights.

### Tools and Process

The tools and process listed below were used to analyze data and provide recommendations:

1. Jupyter Notebook - Exploratory data cleaning and analysis were completed using this notebook.
2. Python Modules - The modules listed below will need to be installed in order to run this notebook.
3. Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (ML) Studio - ML Studio was used to calculate and compare ML models.

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * SciPy
  * Seaborn
  * Matplotlib
  * Scikit-Learn
